      <h1>Our Story: The Journey of Breeze & Bytes</h1>
      <p>
Where It All Began
Breeze & Bytes was born from a simple dream ‚Äî to bring people together over great food, with the sea as our witness. 
Founded in 2012 by a passionate couple who shared a love for coastal serenity and Indian cuisine, our restaurant began as a small seaside eatery with just eight tables, a humble menu, and a vision to create something special. 
Inspired by home-cooked meals, Sunday family lunches, and the romance of sea breezes, Breeze & Bytes started as a place where flavors were personal and every guest was treated like family.</p>

        <h1> Rooted in Tradition, Growing with Passion</h1>
        <p>From day one, our mission has been to celebrate the depth of Indian culinary heritage. Our founders, hailing from different corners of India ‚Äî one from the spice-laden streets of Kerala and the other from the vibrant lanes of Delhi ‚Äî brought their regional influences together in the kitchen. This North-South fusion became the soul of our menu. As word spread, so did our reputation for authenticity, warmth, and food that feels like home. What began as a cozy local spot slowly grew into a destination for families, food lovers, and couples seeking seaside charm.

        <h1> Evolution with Integrity</h1>
        <p>As the years passed, Breeze & Bytes evolved ‚Äî from hand-written menus to curated three-course experiences, from a team of five to a full brigade of passionate chefs and servers. We embraced change, upgraded our interiors for an elevated dining experience, and extended our offerings without ever losing touch with our roots. Even today, our kitchen still uses traditional grinding stones, hand-blends spice mixes, and prepares every dish with the same heart it began with. We've expanded, yes ‚Äî but our soul has remained intact.</p>
