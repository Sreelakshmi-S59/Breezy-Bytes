## 🧠 How It Works (Workflow Explained)

### 🔸 Page Load
- Loads a visually engaging **video background** with a soft **semi-transparent overlay**.
- Central content fades in with tagline, brand name, and call-to-action button.

### 🔸 Interactivity with JavaScript
- **All major buttons** and cards are clickable.
- Each uses `onclick` events in JavaScript to **redirect users** to relevant sections or pages.

### 🔸 CSS Layout
- Uses **Flexbox and Grid** for responsive, modern layouts.
- Cards are enhanced with `::before` overlays for darkening background images and improving text visibility.
- Custom Google Font (**Poppins**) used throughout for clean typography.

### 🔸 Responsive Design
- Media queries adjust layout for screens ≤768px.
- Elements like navbar, feature cards, and headers stack gracefully.
